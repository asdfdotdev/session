# Tests

A number of unit tests are included in this repo and you can [browse our code coverage at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/asdfdotdev/session/).

## Compatibility

### PHPUnit Tests

PHPUnit tests are written for v9.5+

### PHP Code Sniffer

PHP Code Sniffer v3.5+ is recommended.

## Running PHPUnit Tests

From the `_tests/` directory run `$ ../vendor/bin/phpunit` to run the tests. This should result in output similar to:
